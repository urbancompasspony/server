# Universal Server Menu

# What is it?

For now only in Brazillian Portuguese!

A code to run an customizable menu based 100% on Shell Script and created over DIALOG.
It will let you configure your linux server in no time!

Some options are adjust Active Directory over Linux, like creating, removing, blocking or changing password for users and etc; check status of lots of services like apache2, samba, DRBD and etc; create reports and sent them over e-mail, and much more.

# Where to run it

Debian-based Linux machines!
Can't tell if it will works on other linux like Manjaro, Fedora or even CentOS.
I can tell that works on Ubuntu, Debian, LinuxMint, Zorin and more.

When running for the first time it will install some dependencies, they are:
dialog, lm-sensors, whois, arp-scan, traceroute, libatasmart-bin, mutt, udpcast

After install, you will be prompted for your SUDO password to access the administrator functionalities.

# How to run it
