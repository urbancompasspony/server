I can easily reproduce the problem when I enable GPO on the Samba AD DC and then try to do a regular user login on the client. I can also confirm that Valtteri's analysis seems good indeed: the Samba AD DC doesn't create the GptTmpl.inf file automatically, and SSSD doesn't handle this very well

1) The easiest one, as said above, is to use the following setting in your /etc/sssd/sssd.conf:
ad_gpo_access_control = permissive
maybe:
access_provider = ad

2) The other possible solution, as explained by Sumit Bose on that Fedora bug, is to create the GptTpml.inf file by hand with the following contents:

-------- snip --------
[Unicode]
Unicode=yes
[Version]
signature="$CHICAGO$"
Revision=1
-------- snip --------

which, according to Sumit, represents just an empty policy file with a valid header. I tested this workaround here and it seems to work:

# cd /var/lib/samba/sysvol/test.lan/Policies/\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9\}/MACHINE/
# mkdir -p Microsoft/Windows\ NT/SecEdit/
# cd Microsoft/Windows\ NT/SecEdit/
# cat > GptTmpl.inf << EOF
[Unicode]
Unicode=yes
[Version]
signature="$CHICAGO$"
Revision=1
EOF

Then, in the client machine:

# login
sambaclientdc1 login: <email address hidden>
Password:
...
<email address hidden>@sambaclientdc1:~$

I think it is also important to mention that this problem would be introduced anyway if/when you updated to a newer version of Ubuntu, because the recent SSSD versions all have this GPO code in place. As far as I have investigated, it doesn't seem to me that Samba is at fault here.

3) Problems Login SDDM
Edit /usr/lib/systemd/system/sddm.service
and add smb.service to the end of the After line.

I tried adding sssd but it didn't show my freeipa login.
if you want add extra services you should be adding them in an override file in /etc/systemd/system/sddm.service.d/override.conf

[Unit]
After=systemd-user-sessions.service getty@tty1.service plymouth-quit.service systemd-logind.service smb.service
